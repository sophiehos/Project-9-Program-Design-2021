# Project-9-Program-Design-2021
Project 9, Program Design
1. (60 points) Modify Project 8 so that the program is split into three source files and two header
files.
1) Put all functions related to operations on the list of requests into request.c
2) Create a header file named request.h that contains struct request
declaration and prototypes for the functions in request.c. The header file
should enclose the contents of the header file in an #ifndef-#endif pair to
protect the file.
3) Put the read_line function in a separate file named readline.c.
4) Create a header file named readline.h that contains a prototype for the
read_line function. The header file should enclose the contents of the header
file in an #ifndef-#endif pair to protect the file.
5) summer_camp.c contains the main function.
6) Include appropriate header files in the source files.
2. (40 points) Write a makefile to build the program on student cluster. The makefile should
contain the following rules:
1) Build readline.o by compiling readline.c
2) Build request.o by compiling request.c
3) Build summer_camp.o by compiling summer_camp.c
4) Build summer_camp by linking readline.o, request.o, and
summer_camp.o
Each rule should include the name of the target file, dependencies among files, and the command
to be executed. The makefile should name the executable file for the program summer_camp.
Before you submit:
1. (part 1) Compile with the following command and test the program:
gcc â€“Wall request.c readline.c summper_camp.c
./try_summer_camp
2. (part 2) Be sure your makefile contains the information necessary to build the roster
program. Test your makefile:
make summer_camp
./summer_camp
3. Put request.c, request.h, readline.c, readline.h,
summer_camp.c , try_summer_camp, and makefile in a zipped folder. Submit
the zipped folder on Canvas.
Grading
Total points: 100
1. A program that does not compile will result in a zero.
2. Runtime error and compilation warning 5%
3. Commenting and style 15%
4. Functionality 80%:
Part 1: Program divided into appropriate source files and header files.
Part 1: Source files include appropriate header files
Part 1: Header files protected using ifndef-endif
Part 2: makefile implemented the way specified
Programming Style Guidelines
The major purpose of programming style guidelines is to make programs easy to read and
understand. Good programming style helps make it possible for a person knowledgeable in the
application area to quickly read a program and understand how it works.
1. Your program should begin with a comment that briefly summarizes what it does. This
comment should also include your name.
2. In most cases, a function should have a brief comment above its definition describing
what it does. Other than that, comments should be written only needed in order for a
reader to understand what is happening.
3. Information to include in the comment for a function: name of the function, purpose of
the function, meaning of each parameter, description of return value (if any), description
of side effects (if any, such as modifying external variables)
4. Variable names and function names should be sufficiently descriptive that a
knowledgeable reader can easily understand what the variable means and what the
function does. If this is not possible, comments should be added to make the meaning
clear.
5. Use consistent indentation to emphasize block structure.
6. Full line comments inside function bodies should conform to the indentation of the code
where they appear.
7. Macro definitions (#define) should be used for defining symbolic names for numeric
constants. For example: #define PI 3.141592
8. Use names of moderate length for variables. Most names should be between 2 and 12
letters long.
9. Use underscores to make compound names easier to read: tot_vol or
total_volumn is clearer than totalvolumn.
